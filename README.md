Minecraft-Geographic-Generator
==============================

A C++, program which will generate a playable Minecraft world based on Ordnance Survey Terrain (&amp; road) Data and aerial photography.

Uses the ImageMagick Magick++ libraries for image processing. (They're a pain to set up with eclipse...)

My install of eclipse is rather messed up (I blame Android) so a lot of the code was not being correctly compiled, and I did not realise that I did not have much of the polymorphism correct...
