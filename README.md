Minecraft-Geographic-Generator
==============================

A C++, probably Python, and maybe also Java program which generates a playable Minecraft world based on Ordnance Survey Terrain (&amp; road) Data and aerial photography.

Uses the ImageMagick Magick++ libraries for image processing. (They're a pain to set up with eclipse...)

Also likely to use the Python writer https://github.com/twoolie/NBT for the NBT, Anvil, and Region formats.
