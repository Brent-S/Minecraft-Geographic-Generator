Minecraft-Geographic-Generator
==============================

A C++ (Java if that fails...) program which generates a playable Minecraft world based on Ordnance Survey Terrain (&amp; road) Data and aerial photography.

Uses the ImageMagick Magick++ libraries for image processing. (They're a pain to set up with eclipse...)
